# chance-of-deltarune-now
This is an unnecessarily precise calculator for the chance of deltarune coming out. This is built on Python, pygame-ce, and uses the time module's nanosecond precision. How precise is that? Very precise. Is this precision needed? No, only the first 7 digits are really needed for the speed that this program runs. So why would I use more digits? Yes.
